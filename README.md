# Manufacturing Tools

This repository contains small web applications for manufacturing calculations and simple demos.

## Production Cost Calculator

`production_cost.html` provides an easy way to estimate production cost. Enter the number of units, material cost per unit, total labor hours, labor rate, and overhead. The application outputs total material cost, labor cost, overhead, and overall cost per unit.

To use, open the HTML file in your browser and fill out the form.

## Snake Game

`snake.html` is a small in-browser game. Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the canvas and collect the red food blocks. If the snake collides with itself, the game ends and you can restart with the restart button.
