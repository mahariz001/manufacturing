    <h2>Our Facilities</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Knitting Machines</h3>
      <p>We operate over 150 single‑cylinder knitting machines with 6‑feeder drums sourced from Dong Sung of Korea and Da Kong of Taiwan. These machines, featuring electronic yarn sensors and step‑motor adjustments, allow on‑the‑fly design changes and precise control over cylinder, stitch and heel settings. A full expansion will increase capacity to 300 machines across two floors.</p>

      <h3>Steam &amp; Finishing Machines</h3>
      <p>We utilize HELIOT‑SOKMAGIC boarding machines for steam treatment and shaping. Our automatic boarding systems, drum finishers and textile finishing tumblers from Heliot Turkey deliver perfect finishing, softening and antibacterial treatments for every pair.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Metal Detector Machines</h3>
      <p>Each sock passes through a sensitive UK‑made metal detector to identify any broken metal parts after knitting and linking. Our lock‑system detectors can spot fragments as small as 1 mm, ensuring product safety and compliance.</p>

      <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
      <p>Our research and development team sets production standards to guarantee that every finished product meets or exceeds customer specifications.
